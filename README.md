# 🔌 Arduino Projects

This repository is a personal collection of **Arduino-based projects** built during my learning journey in electronics, embedded systems, and interactive hardware. It serves as a space to practice, experiment, and document real-world applications of microcontrollers, sensors, and serial communication.

While originally built for self-education, these projects also act as a portfolio to demonstrate my hands-on experience when applying for engineering roles. All code and documentation are public, and may be useful for other learners or hobbyists exploring similar topics.
